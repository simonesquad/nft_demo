# Hello! This is the supra-repo for the submodule ethereum-boilerplate which I forked from the original boilerplate repo found here: https://github.com/ethereum-boilerplate/ethereum-boilerplate ðŸ¦¾

Current status open pull request on local version: https://github.com/simonesquad/ethereum-boilerplate/pull/1 ðŸ‘€

Updates and further alterations may be ongoing during this year as this is primarily a repo for my use and learning. ðŸŒ»

The exercise was intended to go through the boilerplate and make alterations to fully understand the NFT app's functionality and review critical skills that I gained during an internship in 2021 with a similar Web3 NFT product. ðŸ’…
The original product I worked with can be found here: https://risidio.com/

Topics that were covered and the main functionality:

-Use of Moralis.io database and creating a server: https://moralis.io/
-Connecting to users pre-existing wallets
-Showing current crypto balances after authentication
-Tapping into and displaying existing NFT collections using the API functionality on Moralis
-Adding buy/sell functions to each NFT display
-Connecting the app to an exisiting solidity smart contract that could be deployed and then monitored through Moralis
-Exploring cross-chain functionality within the application
-Displaying on-chain transactions in a dashboard format
-Adding search functionality to search between NFT collections on Open Sea and displaying them as well as interacting with the items shown
-Personalizing built in dashboard displays and customizing individual NFT appearance

Overall a successful learning experience and a great tool for jumping into dAPP creation and the overall NFT app lifecycle process in 2022. Highly recommend giving this a go! ðŸ¤“
